# Proposal for Web Content Accessibility Technology

## Overview

Web Content Accessibility Tools (WCAT) is an open-source project to improve online access to information, services, and products.

Since web accessibility is a public good guaranteed by most democratic governments, this project aims for government support once the project has developed an ecosystem that ensures constant optimization.

## Background

The open-source community has a long history of creating technology to meet the needs of the public good. Open-source software tackles a wide range of societal challenges, including improving access to education, healthcare, and technology. In recent years, the open-source community has been working to improve web accessibility for people with disabilities.

One example of this is the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard, which provides a set of attributes that can be added to HTML to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. ARIA was developed through a collaborative effort by members of the open-source community and has been widely adopted by web developers as a way to make their content more accessible.

## Proposal

The Web Content Accessibility Tools (WCAT) project will focus on providing modern and optimized accessibility technology that makes it easier for web developers and content creators to ensure that their content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

The WCAT project will include the following components:

1. Accessibility Testing Tools: The project will develop fast and reliable accessibility testing tools that help developers test and remediate website accessibility issues. These tools will be able to handle "the volume of the internet," meaning the tools must process countless web pages that exist on the internet.
2. Accessibility Libraries: The project will develop modern and optimized accessibility libraries that provide developers with code snippets, services, and components to ensure their web applications are accessible. These libraries will give easy-to-use building blocks for creating accessible web content.
3. Clear Documentation and Training: The code WCAT publishes must be easy-to-understand. We intend to provide an extensive library of resources around the technology developers of WCAT implement, including in-person and remote training opportunities.

The WCAT project will be open-source and developed with the broader web development community. The project will be hosted on a public code repository, and contributions will be welcome from anyone interested in improving web content accessibility.

## Desired Outcomes

The project to create Web Content Accessibility Tools (WCAT) will be crucial in promoting web accessibility for people with disabilities. By providing developers and content creators with clear learning resources and modern accessibility technology that can scale to the volume of the internet, the project will expand the horizons of humanity, helping to ensure that the web is a truly inclusive platform that everyone can use.
