Overview:

Web Content Accessibility Technology (WCAT) is an open-source project aimed at improving the accessibility of web content for people with disabilities. The goal of this project is to provide modern and optimized accessibility technology tools and resources that help website developers and content creators ensure that their websites are accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

Web content accessibility is a public good because it ensures equal access to information, services, and products online. By making web content more accessible, we can promote inclusivity and enable people with disabilities to fully participate in the digital world.

History:

The open-source community has a long history of creating technology to meet the needs of the public good. Open-source software has been used to tackle a wide range of societal challenges, including improving access to education, healthcare, and technology. In recent years, the open-source community has been working to improve web accessibility for people with disabilities.

One example of this is the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard, which provides a set of attributes that can be added to HTML to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. ARIA was developed through a collaborative effort by members of the open-source community and has been widely adopted by web developers as a way to make their content more accessible.

Proposal:

The Web Content Accessibility Technology (WCAT) project will focus on providing modern and optimized accessibility technology tools and resources that make it easier for web developers and content creators to ensure that their content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

The WCAT project will include the following components:

Accessibility Testing Tools: The project will develop modern and optimized accessibility testing tools that help developers test their websites for accessibility issues. These tools will provide detailed reports on the accessibility of web content and provide suggestions for improving accessibility.
Accessibility Libraries: The project will develop modern and optimized accessibility libraries that provide developers with code snippets and components that can be used to ensure that their web applications are accessible. These libraries will be based on the ARIA standard and will provide easy-to-use building blocks for creating accessible web content.
The WCAT project will be open-source and will be developed in collaboration with the wider web development community. The project will be hosted on a public code repository, and contributions will be welcome from anyone who is interested in improving web content accessibility.

Conclusion:

The Web Content Accessibility Technology (WCAT) project will play a crucial role in promoting web accessibility for people with disabilities. By providing developers and content creators with modern and optimized accessibility technology tools and resources, the project will help to ensure that the web is a truly inclusive platform that everyone can use. We believe that this project has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of people with disabilities, and we look forward to working with the open-source community to make it a reality.
